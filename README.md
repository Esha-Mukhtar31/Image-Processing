# Image Processing Assignments

This repository contains implementations of **Image Processing** techniques in Python.  
The current assignment focuses on **Otsu's Thresholding** for image binarization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Load and process an image in Python.
- Convert image from RGB to Grayscale.
- Compute **Otsuâ€™s optimal threshold** for segmentation.
- Compare results with a fixed threshold value (128).
- Display:
  - Original Image
  - Grayscale Image
  - Histogram with Otsu's Threshold
  - Binarized Images (Otsu vs Fixed Threshold)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Matplotlib
